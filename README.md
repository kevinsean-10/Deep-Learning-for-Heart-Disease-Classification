📚 Overview

Heart disorders are a common health issue influenced by various factors. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial, often relying on the assessment of symptoms. By utilizing historical data of heart disease patients, this project applies Deep Learning (DL) techniques to predict heart disease presence based on detected symptoms.

This repository presents a comparative analysis of Deep Learning models for heart disease classification, focusing specifically on:
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)


🛠️ Project Details

- MLP Models: Built using three different Python packages. 
- CNN Models: Enhanced by applying two feature dimension reduction techniques.
- Variations Considered: Layers, epochs, features, and learning rate were adjusted during training.


📈 Findings

- MLP models consistently outperformed CNN models, mainly because MLPs fully utilize available data, minimizing information loss.
- All models achieved high accuracy, consistently exceeding 70%.


⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional, for data visualization)
